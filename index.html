                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    
                    <div class="paragraf"></div>Marin Kitagawa is a slim and above-average height girl with a light skin tone. Her eyes are a dark brown naturally, although she is almost always seen with dark pink color contacts (outside of her cosplaying). Her build is on the thinner side with a small waistline. She has silky blonde hair, tipped with pinkish-red or citrus orange, reaching down around her waist. Her bangs cover a majority of her forehead and eyebrows, reaching around the start of her eyelashes. Two locks of hair also flow over her shoulders and end around her chest region. Her hairstyles include long straight hair, a single ponytail, a double ponytail, a double knot on top, a bun, and a single top ponytail. In terms of gradient, her hair goes from pure blonde at the top and progressively becomes pinkish-red or citrus-orange towards the bottom. She does wear ear piercings which include one ring piercing, three pearl piercings, and an industrial piercing on the left ear and two ring piercings, and one pearl piercing on the right ear.<br>
                    <div class="paragraf"></div>Her fashion sense varies according to where she is. At school, she wears a white button shirt with one chest pocket on her left, a navy blue tie, a plaid skirt, black socks, and brown shoes. She also tends to wear a stretchy black choker, two bracelets on her left arm, and a ring on both her right pinky and left index finger. When she is going somewhere casual, she tends to wear various outfits that fit her liking.

                <div class="paragraf"></div>She wears a black shoulder-length wig with a violet tint, her bangs slightly spread out and covering her forehead, extending just above the fake eyelashes. The eyelashes are moderately long but only on the outer corners of the eye to create a droopy eye impression. She wears purple color contacts and her eyeshadow is red. Her eyebrows are shaved and new eyebrows are drawn to best mimic the expression. She wears a black mob cap with three red artificial roses on top, the mob cap having an embroidered rose pattern. She dons a black maid gown with frills where the arm meets the torso. The cuffs are extended to cover the hand and widen towards the end like a cone and the end is ruffled. There is a brown leather choker attached to a metal ring with a chain extending from it. She also wears a tie. Her breast pockets cover the breasts, with two strings tied in a loopback pattern going from frill to frill. A few nubras are stacked beneath the breast pockets to make them look bigger. She is slimmest directly beneath the breasts, where the dress starts. There are at least three layers to the dress, including a crinoline to make the dress look fluffy. The top layer is a rose embroidered pattern with frilled at the end, then there's a black layer and a frilled layer beneath. She wears black rose embroidered stockings. There is also a tulle and garter belt. The stockings are connected to the underwear with two strings on each leg. She wears black platform heels. The number 17 is written on her thighs, right beneath the underwear, as a detail of how many times Shizuku had intercourse. The way 17 is written is by Chinese telly marks so there is added another telly mark by each intercourse Shizuku has had. Why it says 17 is unknown, it might be what Marin got in her playthrough of Saint â™¡ Slippery's Academy for Girls - The Young Ladies of the Humiliation Club: Debauched Miracle Life 2.
